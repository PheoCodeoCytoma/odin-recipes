    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chicken Florentine, with perfectly-seared boneless chicken breasts in a creamy white wine and spinach sauce, is a complete, one-skillet dinner, easy enough for a weeknight, fancy enough for a date night.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 (10-oz. each) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in half horizontally</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir together flour and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a medium bowl. Add chicken cutlets, one at a time, and toss to coat evenly with flour. Shake off excess flour, and set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add butter and oil; cook, swirling occasionally, until butter is frothy, about 30 seconds. Add chicken in an even layer; cook, turning once halfway through, until browned and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of breast registers 165Â°F, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Add wine to skillet; cook over high, stirring occasionally and scraping bottom to release brown bits, until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Stir in stock, cream, black pepper, garlic, oregano, thyme,  marjoram, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in spinach; cook, stirring often, until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to skillet. Cook over medium-high, turning chicken once, until chicken is heated through, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat; add basil and Parmesan, swirling to combine.</li>
    </ol>
